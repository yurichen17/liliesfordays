            <p> I am a big video game fan, so I wanted to challenge myself to make my own video game. </p>
            <p> Too Many Mines is a game that involves mines, score multipliers, and a little bit of risk. There is a 5x5 grid that contains 
            hidden tiles. These tiles can be a 1, 2, 3, or a bomb. There are hint tiles on the edge of the grid that tells you how many bombs are
            in each row or column. You play the game by flipping the tiles; if you flip a bomb, you lose! If you flip a 1, your score gets
            multiplied by 1x. If you flip a 2, your score is multiplied by 2x. If you flip a 3, your score is multitplied by 3x. </p>
            <p>Flip all the 2 and 3 tiles to move onto the next level. After completeing a level, you can push your luck to try for 
            higher scores, but if you hit a bomb, you lose your score! </p>

            <p>This game has similar actions as the game Minesweeper, so as a new Unity programer, I decided to start with looking up tutorials of how Minesweeper
             is made. I then used those ideas and altered them to fit my game. There was a lot of trial and error, and lots of "outside-the-box" thinking to solve 
             some problems I was facing. Unity is not like anything I've used before. Thank goodness for Stack Overflow!</p>

            <p> I also made the graphics for the game which was a nice Photoshop break from coding.</p>

          <p class = "project-header"> How It Works </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>I created a class called "tiles" which can be a oneTile, twoTile, threeTile, or zeroTile (a bomb). The level setup goes like this:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>I add in a set amount of twoTiles randomly into to the 2D array.</li>
              <li>I add in a set amount of threeTiles randomly into the 2D array</li>
              <li>I add in a set amount of bombs randomly into the 2D array</li>
              <li>As the level number increase, so does the number of twoTiles, threeTiles, and bombs.</li>
              <li>I fill the remaining spaces in the 2D array with oneTiles. </li>
              <li>I go through the 2D array and count the number of bombs in each row and column, and then display it as a hint on the sides of the 2D array.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Depending on if the player passes or fails the level, I change the scene in Unity. If a player passes, two buttons appear. One will move them to the next level,
            and the other will save their highscore and return them to the main page. </p>
