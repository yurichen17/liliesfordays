            <p> As the League of Legends Community Director at Umich Esports, I wanted to connect and bring together 
            the large amount of students that played League of Legends at UMich. During Fall of 2020, I proposed the 
            idea of Round Robins where students can sign up and play games with other UMich students. All skill levels 
            are allowed; I wanted students to be able learn and teach the game, as well as make new friends. </p>
            <p> The Round Robins took place about every two weeks. For each Round Robin, we would have to make new teams
            depending on signups. The process of creating balanced teams where the skill level was approximately even on 
            both teams was tedious when done by hand. </p>
            <p> To really see how tedious it would be, here is what team making depended on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rank of players (their skill level). </li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are 9 tiers and 4 divisions each, meaning 36 different ranks!</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Primary role (the position the player most wants to play). 
              <ul>
                <li>There are 5 roles in League, and most people only like to play 2 roles.  </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Secondary role (the backup position)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If the player cannot get their primary role, then we can try to give them their secondary role</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Fill players</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Fill players don't have any role preference, which is good! But it feels like a whole other role when making teams by hand</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p> So, there is a lot that goes into balancing teams than meets the eye.</p>
          </div>
          <p class = "project-header"> The Planning </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>I spent a couple days thinking about how the algorithm would work, and also consulted my friend who is the 
            League of Legends coach for Northeastern University. Here are some notes I took, and also the beginning of balancing rank:</p>
            <img src="../../assets/teamnotes.png" height="500px">
            <p> From there, I started to come up with a flow-chart 
            for an algorithm I thought would work. With some Youtube videos about Google Sheets API, and a lot of time later,
            I coded a script that would take Google Sheets responses, make teams, and print them out on Google Sheets. Hooray!</p>
          </div>
          <p class = "project-header"> How It Works </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>Here is how the algorithm works, in list form, and simplified:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>I use Google Sheets API to take in a bunch of information about the players</li>
              <li>I go through the list of players randomly, looking at their primary role. If possible, I add them to a team.</li>
              <li>If the team is not full after going through the players, I look at the remaining players' secondary role and add if possible</li>
              <li>If the team is still not full, I add in fill players to fill the teams.</li>
              <li>If team is not full at this point, restart the algorithm</li>
              <li>If team is full, add to best team variable to keep track of best team so far</li>
              <li>If teams are made but there is a large skill difference between the two teams, restart.</li>
              <li>Repeat for making the other teams. If at any point, the teams cannot be filled, restart. I have counters in place so it won't go infinitely.</li>
              <li>After it runs 10 times, it will take the best teams made and print them out on the Google Sheet.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Below is a google sheet that I used to test if the code worked. "Players" has all the players that entered the Round Robin. "Teams" has 6 teams and therefore 3 matches that can be played at the same time, and each team has their score on the left. 
            The algorithm is set so the team scores cannot differ by more than 10. </p>
