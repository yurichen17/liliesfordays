          <div class="tab">
            <p>After being promoted to Head of Events of Michigan Esports, my position as League of Legends community director was 
            passeed down to other students who now work under me on the event commitee. I wanted to turn my team balancing script 
            into a website that my League of Legends community directors can use to create balanced League of Legends teams.</p>
            <p>I recently organized a gaming event that over 125 people came to. Over 30 people game for League of Legends. For the 
            next event I'll be holding, I'll be telling my staff to use this website to save a lot of time.</p>

          <p class = "project-header"> The Planning </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>I already wrote the algorithm in python. Since I'm currently taking 493 User Interface Development and learned about
            Vue.js in lecture, I decided it would be good practice to use Vue and Javascript for this project.</p>
            <p> Here's my process.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>I first drew a draft interface on Concepts.</li>
                <img src = "../../assets/concept.png" height="500px">
                <li>I started doing a bunch of research of what I could do in terms of accessing the Google Sheets for information.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>My previous script used a service account to access a certain spreadsheet. If I used a service account again, I would 
                    have to somehow need to have the user share their sheet with the service account.</li>
                    <li>I could have the website share the form that the user should use to collect data. There would be two buttons on the website;
                    one to run the script on the information on the sheet, one to clear the forms/the spreadsheet.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>The first option seemed like a hassle to continue sharing the sheet with a suspicious service account name. The second option
                seemed like it could work, but Google Sheets doesn't have an option to clear forms.</li>
                <li>Luckily, creating an API key to view public spreadsheets seemed to be the best solution. So, that's what I went with.</li>
                <li>I tested the API calling by typing in a sheet_id using Vue and Axios to fetch.</li>
                <li>I recoded my Python script into Javascript</li>
                <li>I use Vue to dynamically change the page and display the matches.</li>
              </ol>
            <p> Having the script in Python origianlly made the algorithm part of this project much easier to code. I was able to 
            reuse more code this time around by creating more generic functions.</p>
          </div>
          <p class = "project-header"> How It Works </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>Check out my Team Maker Script page to see how the algorithm works. Below is how a user would experience this website:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>A community director makes a copy of the linked form on the website and send it out to all the players that want to play.</li>
              <li>Once all the users have filled it out, the community director publishes the sheet to the web.</li>
              <li>The community director takes the sheet_id and inputs it into the website text input.</li>
              <li>They press "Generate" to generate teams</li>
              <li>The teams are all outputted onto the website dynamically.</li>
            </ol>
