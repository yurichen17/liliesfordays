            <p>This project is actually part of Cloudflare's take home assignment. I had so much fun coding this that I wanted to show it off here on
              my website! It had the perfect amount of coding and design and I just love how it turned out.
            </p>
            <p>The general concepts of this project is using Cloudflare workers to handle HTTP GET and POST requests. You also use Cloudflare KV to add a 
              database portion to the application. Then, you create a front end with React and put it all together!</p>
          </div>
          <p class = "project-header"> The Planning </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>The project was very open ended. For some reason, I wanted to call my project "Snips" since you would be posting small text bits on 
              the social media application. I started to roll with this idea as I was coding the backend of this project. I had never used Cloudflare
              before this so I did a lot of googling to learn syntax and how to use the Cloudflare workers.
            </p>
            <p> Here's my process.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>I read through the prompt and researched Cloudflare, Cloudflare workers, and Cloudflare KV to build the backend.</li>
                <li>I spread out the work between these few segments and aimed to complete one section in a day or two:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Creating a worker to accept GET requests</li>
                    <li>Creating a worker to accept POST requests</li>
                    <li>Creating the front end in React</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Testing the GET requests was simple since when the webpage loaded, that would be a GET request so I could see if the information
                  in the GET request was properly accessing the Cloudflare KV.
                </li>
                <li>Getting the POST requests to work took a bit longer. I had issues that arose from not fulling understanding Cloudflare workers at the time.
                  To test POST requests, I figured out how to send curl requests as a POST request to try and alter the KV database.
                </li>
                <li>The front end was the most fun for me. From the idea of calling my web app "Snipits," I decided for a scissors theme
                  and drew a sample wire frame.
                </li>
                <img src="../../assets/snipits.jpg" height="500px">
                <li>I used the Cloudflare workers I made to send GET and POST requests on my React app to display and upload posts. 
                </li>
                <li>I then added styling and animated scissors on Adobe Photoshop. I wanted the scissors to "cut" the messages out as you submit a post. I was so happy when it worked!</li>
              </ol>
            <p> Having the script in Python origianlly made the algorithm part of this project much easier to code. I was able to 
            reuse more code this time around by creating more generic functions.</p>

              <li>The post get saved into the database by sending a POST request.</li>
              <li>The web app does another GET request to grab the updated info.</li>
              <li>The scissors snip!</li>
              <li>The new post shows below and is saved for all to see.</li>
