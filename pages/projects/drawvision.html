            <p> After taking 442 - Computer Vision, I wanted to make a small project that would incorperate what I learned in the class.
            The class was both challenging and rewarding, and taught me some valuable lessons as well. I had not learned python directly; 
            95% of my python knowledge is from this very computer vision class! In the beginning, I was afraid of falling behind my peers
            since I did not know python. With some tutorials and visiting office hours, I was able to get through the first homework. As the
            semester continued on, it became easier to use python. 442 taught me to not give up!</p>

          <p class = "project-header"> The Planning </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p> I really wanted this project to have some work done in Google Colab, but couldn't figure out how to tie Google Colab to an
            html website. After watching some videos, I figured I would have the most luck if I could make the drawing application in html, and then
            somehow send the finished drawing through a trained computer vision model that would spit out a prediction of the image. I ended up using 
            the "canvas" object in html to make the drawing board, and then sent the drawing to a tensorflow model that would return predictions.</p>
          </div>
          <p class = "project-header"> How It Works </p> 
          <div class="tab">
            <p>I had some trouble trying to save a canvas state (with the drawing inside) as an image. With tons of stack overflow, the canvas state was still
            saved as a strange state of strings. I had a great idea to set it equal to an image object first and it worked! </p>

            
            <p>Some problems I now see with this is that the prediction probabilities are quite low. I think it's because the model was trained on actual
            pictures instead of drawings. If I were to do this project again, I would try and find an image set of drawings, and train on those instead of using
            mobile.net for their model.</p>
