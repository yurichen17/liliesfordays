			<p> My name is Yuri Chen and I'm a Computer Science major and Art and Design minor at the University of Michigan. I'll be graduating in April 2023. 
				I'm currently working on a script that will help me balance teams as the League of Legends community director at UMich.
				Besides classes, I am also part of a volunteer program called Center for Sucess in Detroit that helps increase literacy in children.
                I love to help people and hope that my work will be about making things easier and more accessible for the rest of the population.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I love to make art. It keeps me thinking creatively when in a static classes about computer science.
                I also like running outside, doing jigsaw puzzels, knitting, learning about video game design, and making music.
